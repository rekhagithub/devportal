          <li>APIs have  simple plug and play capabilities by themselves or if needed then a cluster can be made in order to retrieve the information that is needed.</li>
          <li>You can save the clusters that suit your needs in order to easily call them whenever you want in a quick and easy manner.</li>

        <h3>Get Access to APIs</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Before you request access to specific APIs, first you need to determine what you need.</li><br>
        <li>Once you know what you need the APIs for and which APIs fit those needs then you can request access to use specific APIs.</li><br>
        <li>Upon gaining access you can begin to test and implement the APIs in your everyday use.</li><br> 
      </ul>

     <h3>Access test environment</h3>
     <p>Once you have selected the APIs that you think will work best for your business, you can test the APIs in a free environment
       with no cost to you so that you can make sure that the APIs you have requested are fully functional and 
       tested before you are charged for them.</p>

      <h3>Try it out in the Sandbox</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Use different APIs in the Sandbox in order to see how the APIs can be integrated together or how they work by themselves.</li><br>
      <li>This feature can be used by beginners or by people who have more experience with working with APIs.</li><br>

      <h3>Go Live</h3>
      <p>Once the API is functional in the test environment then it is time to Go Live with the API and use it for. </p><br><br>
